This project is a starting point for the mobile team assessment flutter application.

A few instructions before you start the ssessment:

## Assessment Question:

XYZ inc. is interested in automating its processes and has a project for you to work on. At the end of every year, employees are given a productivity score which affexts their status with the company:

- 100 – 80 : A promotion and consequential pay increase
- 79 – 50 : No change
- 49 – 40 : A demotion
- 39 and below : Termination

You have been assigned to build mobile system that primarily handles this for the people at XYZ inc. They do, however have a few secondary requirements which are:

- The list of employees can be retrieved from Api.successResponse and should be displayed on the home screen as wll as saved in a local database
- The employees can be filtered by name, designation or level
- When an employee is tapped, their employee details where their employment status and new salary can be determined
  - Level 0 = 70,000
  - Level 1 – 100,000,
  - Level 2 – 120,000,
  - Level 3 – 180,000,
  - Level 4 – 200,000
  - Level 5 – 250,000
- Simulate an error response from Api.errorResponse on the home page
- A level 0 employee cannot be demoted, only terminated if need be.
